Stereotypic nucleosome positions are identified from dyad density maps using an approach similar to the previously reported greedy algorithm in GeneTrack_ (Albert, et al. 2008). Nucleosome calls are identified at peak maxima (p) in the smoothed dyad density map, and then excluded in the surrounding window [pâ€“N, p+N], where N is the assumed nucleosome size in base pairs. This process is continued until all possible sterically hindered nucleosome positions are identified.

This tool requires dyad counts and smoothed dyad counts in Wig or BigWig format. Smoothed dyad counts can be generated from dyad counts using the WigMath -> Gaussian smooth tool.

-----

**Syntax**

- **Dyad counts** is the relative number of nucleosomes positioned at each base pair.
- **Smoothed dyad counts** should correspond to a smoothed version of the **Dyad counts**  
- **Assumed nucleosome size** is the window size used while identifying maxima to restrict overlapping calls.  

-----

**Output**

The output format has 10 columns defined as follows

- 1. **Chromosome:** the chromosome of this nucleosome call
- 2. **Start:** the lower coordinate of the call window, equal to the dyad position - N/2
- 3. **Stop:** the higher coordinate of the call window, equal to the dyad position + N/2
- 4. **Length:** the window size (N) of the nucleosome call, equal to the value specified when the tool was run
- 5. **Length standard deviation:** the standard deviation of the nucleosome call length (equal to 0 because it is not currently calculated)
- 6. **Dyad:** the location of the peak maximum (p) in the smoothed dyad density data
- 7. **Dyad standard deviation:** the standard deviation of dyad density around the dyad mean in the dyad counts data
- 8. **Conditional position:** the probability that a nucleosome is at this exact dyad location as opposed to anywhere else in the nucleosome call window [p-N/2, p+N/2]
- 9. **Dyad mean:** the mean of the dyad counts in the window [p-N/2, p+N/2]
- 10. **Occupancy:** the sum of the dyad counts in the window [p-N/2, p+N/2]
